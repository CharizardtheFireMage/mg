  "body": "-Do not ban people unless it is absolutely necessary. I only ban when users continue to defy authority or when they spam intentionally. (Usually i'll lock for that but if i'm not on then ban.)\r\n-You are expected to know ALL the tiers well enough so that you could explain to anyone, including someone that just came into the room.\r\n-You may nominate for mod-there is no mod room, but the room owners will take it into consideration.\r\n-You are not to tell drivers that you nominated them. If I find out, you will be in big trouble.\r\n-Mod is hard to earn, but it is not overly hard to lose. You will lose this position if you do not do enough in the room. GUARANTEED. I expect to see at least 30, preferably 40 or more logged actions in the course of a month.\r\n-If you have to go on a leave for any reason, make sure you tell 13490ufd.",
