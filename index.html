        <p>-Do not ban people unless it is absolutely necessary. I only ban when users continue to defy authority or when they spam intentionally. (Usually i'll lock for that but if i'm not on then ban.)
-You are expected to know ALL the tiers well enough so that you could explain to anyone, including someone that just came into the room.
-You may nominate for mod-there is no mod room, but the room owners will take it into consideration.
-You are not to tell drivers that you nominated them. If I find out, you will be in big trouble.
-Mod is hard to earn, but it is not overly hard to lose. You will lose this position if you do not do enough in the room. GUARANTEED. I expect to see at least 30, preferably 40 or more logged actions in the course of a month.
-If you have to go on a leave for any reason, make sure you tell 13490ufd.</p>
